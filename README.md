# shooting-game

So this is a shooting game that I made while going through a class on Skillshare. I'm not going to post the assets because they were a part of the class, but I will leave a link to this person's YouTube channel so that anyone interested can check them out as well.

This is just the coding part. If you wanted to you could get or create your own assets and use them. This is basically for me to get an idea of how to start out making a game in Pygame.
